* Requirements: a recent R with Bioconductor installed. Additional packages can be 
  installed with the shell script in source/shell/install_packages.sh. Note that for
  Gene ST microarrays it is also required to install the appropriate CDF and probe 
  packages (from http://bioinfo.i-med.ac.at).
* Rename folder and "MAIN-affymetrix-analysis.tex" according to the project.
* Define a phenodata file (e.g. phenodata.txt) and put it in data/txt. This file should
  list all microarrays of the experiment and define the groups. Required/suggested columns
  are: CEL, name, group.
* Modify the rawdata-preprocessing.Rnw according to the setup. Note: this file works only
  for the "older" 3' microarrays (e.g. hgu133plus2). To analyze newer generation microarrays
  (i.e. gene ST microarrays), use the rawdata-preprocessing-gene-st.Rnw. In the latter case
  CDF and probe packages have to be installed for the microarray from http://bioinfo.i-med.ac.at.
* Differential expression analysis is defined in diffexp.Rnw.

* The Rnw and the basic set up of this type of analysis was defined and set-up by:
  - Julien Lelong
  - Daniel Bindreither
  - Johannes Rainer
